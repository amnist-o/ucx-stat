## ANCOVA
ANOVA but there are other variables in the model which we need to account for.

Basically, it is that we want to compare not only the variables we are interested in but all the variables that affect the output. Take a look at weight and height data:

```{r load package, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("datasets/howell1.csv",sep=";")
dat %>%
  filter(age >= 18) %>%
  mutate(male = factor(male)) -> dat
m1 <- lm(weight ~ height, data = dat)
m2 <- update(m1, .~height*male)
anova(m1,m2)
```

In this case, we do not spot statistically significant differences between the sex in weight after adjusting for height.
